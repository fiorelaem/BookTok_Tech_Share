**Introduction**
We are going to teach you how to use React Webcam and React Mic Recorder to MP3, because not only are they useful as a web developer, but it can help all of us with some of the requirements for Project 2! These two features are interesting on their own, but even more so when together. With device integration we tend to see patterns like developers needing to use multiple features at once or together, so learning different libraries such as these two that can help you use the camera and audio recording is useful. 

React webcam is a React Javascript library that helps web developers utilize the web camera to record in-progress pictures or videos. It supports both mobile and desktop devices that have embedded cameras and it has several adaptable functions that you can use with your applications. React Mic Recorder to MP3 is a separate JS library that records audio. 

We will be showing you how to set up React Webcam using Native React JS and Next JS and install all the dependencies,  set up your camera constraints such as height, width, and pixels, how to screenshot, capture, and smooth photos, capture videos, how to set up and use the mic component, and give everyone a chance to try it out on their own devices!
